# wtfubar
Fork of NetBSD's wtf

## History
The wtfubar package was forked from NetBSD's wtf due to differences over what
is considered offensive and acceptable to have in the repository, and the
scope of the acronyms database. This package maintains the split of the
acronyms file into acronyms-o for acronyms which might be considered
offensive, and the original syntax within the files. It tracks additions to
the original package and merges them here.

## Contributions
Yes, please! Let's keep it relevant to the life, the Internet, and computers.
This package, its authors, and contributors do not assume that it's all-
inclusive, so please send your suggestions. Include some source - Urban
Dictionary, Encyclopedia Dramatica, etc. - with your addition, so we're not
MSU. Subculture acronyms and abbreviations are acceptable. The whitespace
separator for the acronyms files is one tab, not spaces.

## License
As with the original wtf package, this package is released under the public
domain license.

## See Also
The MirOS Project has a web-accessible version of wtf (as CGI) at
https://www.mirbsd.org/wtf.htm with a form to look up acronyms online
and a download link for their version of the acronyms database, which
is similarily uncensored but with a much extended scope (e.g. acronyms
in different languages, Morse code, etc).
